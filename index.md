## Welcome to nf-core

nf-core is a GitHub organisation containing a curated set of
analysis pipelines built using [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) -
a tool and language that can be used for highly scalable
and portable workflows.

Nextflow is an incredibly flexible and powerful tool. Like any tool,
it comes with a learning curve. Here, we have collected a number of
pipelines written using Nextflow that all adhere to a set of "best practice"
guidelines. This means that if one works on your system, then they all should.

These pipelines can be used as they are _(why reinvent the wheel?)_, can be used
as inspiration, or can be used as a starting point for something different.
Everything is released with the MIT licence, so you're free to use the code
however you would like.
