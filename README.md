[**nf-core**](https://github.com/nf-core) is a GitHub organisation containing a curated set of analysis pipelines built using nextflow - a tool and language that can be used for highly scalable and portable workflows.

This repository contains the files used to generate the documentation website for nf-core: https://nf-core.github.io/

The website uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with the [Cayman theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman). There are a few customisations to override parts of the default template (see `_layouts` and `assets/css`).
Under the hood, the website files are being dynamically generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

If you prefer, you can read all of the website content on GitHub.com instead:

* [Homepage](index.md)
* [Pipelines](pipelines.md)
* [Docs](docs.md)
* [About](about.md)

Otherwise, head over to https://nf-core.github.io and enjoy!
