<div id="pipelines_content" style="display:none;">
    <div id="production_pipelines" style="display:none;">
        <h2>Production Pipelines</h2>
    </div>


    <div id="development_pipelines" style="display:none;">
        <h2>Pipelines in development</h2>
        <p>These pipelines aren't yet ready for the prime-time, but are under active development. <br>
