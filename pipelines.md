# Available Pipelines

Ok, so it's early days and we haven't ported any pipelines across just yet. They're coming though! These are the ones that we have in mind:

* [SciLifeLab/NGI-RNAseq](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-RNAseq)
* [SciLifeLab/NGI-smRNAseq](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-smRNAseq)
* [SciLifeLab/NGI-ChIPseq](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-ChIPseq)
* [SciLifeLab/NGI-MethylSeq](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-MethylSeq)
* [SciLifeLab/NGI-ExoSeq](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-ExoSeq)
* [SciLifeLab/NGI-RNAfusion](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-RNAfusion)
* [SciLifeLab/NGI-NeutronStar](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-NeutronStar)
* [SciLifeLab/NGI-CellRaiser](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-CellRaiser)

Note that these are not all complete pipelines - some are still under heavy development.

Most pipelines follow conventions seen in the [nf-core/cookiecutter](https://github.com/nf-core/cookiecutter) pipeline template.

Got another that would fit in well? [Let us know!](https://github.com/nf-core/nf-core.github.io/issues/new)
