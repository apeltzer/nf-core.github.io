# Available Pipelines

Most pipelines follow conventions seen in the [nf-core/cookiecutter](https://github.com/nf-core/cookiecutter) pipeline template.

Got another that would fit in well? [Let us know!](https://github.com/nf-core/nf-core.github.io/issues/new)

<div id="production_pipelines">
<h2>Production Pipelines</h2>
</div>


<div id="development_pipelines">
<h2>Pipelines in development</h2>
<p>These pipelines aren't yet ready for the prime-time, but are under active development.</p>
<p>Once they've had a release on GitHub, they will be classed as production-ready pipelines.</p>
</div>

### Coming soon...
It's still early days for the `nf-core` project and we haven't ported many pipelines across just yet. They're coming though! These are the ones that we have in mind:

* [SciLifeLab/NGI-RNAseq](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-RNAseq)
* [SciLifeLab/NGI-smRNAseq](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-smRNAseq)
* [SciLifeLab/NGI-ChIPseq](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-ChIPseq)
* [~~SciLifeLab/NGI-MethylSeq~~](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-MethylSeq) - _done_
* [SciLifeLab/NGI-ExoSeq](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-ExoSeq)
* [SciLifeLab/NGI-RNAfusion](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-RNAfusion)
* [SciLifeLab/NGI-NeutronStar](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-NeutronStar)
* [SciLifeLab/NGI-CellRaiser](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-CellRaiser)

Note that these are not all complete pipelines - some are still under heavy development.
